# Modular Model Rocket 3D files

## Instructions

> Pick a nosecone, body tube(s), fincan, nosecone coupler, and voila! A semi custom printable rocket!

A minimum 4x4x4" build area is required to print all parts individually.

The rocket parts are designed to have **.35mm layers** and **1.5 width over thickness**, so the tubes are exactly **two** extruded filaments wide. The walls are pretty thin so printing at other settings may produce hollow walls, which probably won't work well.

### Step 1:
Select Components. You will need a nosecone, body tube, fincan, and nosecone coupler. You can use multiple body tubes to make a longer rocket if desired. See below for recommended combinations.

### Step 2:
Print parts. You may need to sand some mating surfaces or add tape for the correct fit.

### Step 3:
Screw and glue nosecone to coupler.

### Step4:
Tie the nosecone coupler to the fin can through the body tube with 3ft of non-flammable cord. Attach a parachute or streamer if desired `HIGHLY RECOMMENDED`

### Step 5:
Insert Motor and add short drywall screw to the rear of the rocket for motor retention. You can also put tape around the rocket motor for a tight friction fit.

### Step 6:
Fly safely and have fun!
